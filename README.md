# Introduction to LCD screens at the Wond'ry


Welcome to the workshop. Today we'll be learning about LCDs, Arduino, 
and the things that go with them. 

To begin, download the Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). 
Then download the ZIP file of this repository (near top right 
of the page). Then install the LiquidCrystal_I2C library in the Arduino IDE.

The goal of this workshop is to have your LCD workshop reading a voltage
from a potentiometer through a voltage divider.

Good luck, and have fun!
